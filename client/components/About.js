        After years of experience working in the Fashion and Advertising
        industries in New York City, I decided to start my own sustainable
        swimwear brand in 2019. In the process of running my business, I became
        intrigued and later passionate about web development.

        As a creative thinker and a problem solver, Software Engineering is the
        perfect fit where I can find the best of both worlds, while navigating a
        career path with endless possibilities. The main goals for my business
        have always been sustainability, minority representation and support,
        and it is my intention to bring the same ideals to my Software
        Engineering journey.
